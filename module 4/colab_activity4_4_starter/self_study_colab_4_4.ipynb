    "On average, customers who accept an offer spend more than customers that do not. The largest delta is between 0 and 1 offers accepted, the difference in median being ~$550. The incremental increase in spend tailors off with each subsequent offer accepted, which suggests diminishing returns. A customer's income may play a small role in offer acceptance, with a positive correlation of 0.29. There was a strong correlation between income and total spend, 0.67. Total offers accepted and the total amount spent are also positively correlated at 0.46. These correlations are also visualized in the scatter and histogram plots. From a business perspective, we may find more success by targeting higher income customers with adverts containing offers. We may also want to consider why offers are not catching the eyes of customers with lower incomes.\n"

I would like to verify when this dataset was created to ensure freshness and accuracy. I removed outliers using the IQR method for age and all the amount fields. From the data I saw that on average, online customers between the first and third quartile spend the most on wine by a large margin. Meat follows this but by a large margin. Given that wine's price can vary greatly this is not much of a surprise. I would like to see counts for these products to help decide inventory needs."
